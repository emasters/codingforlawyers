# Preface

Welcome to Coding for Lawyers.

A few stylistic notes:
1. I occasionally put punctuation outside of quotation marks. This is a habit developed from years of legislative drafting, but it has now become a way for me to semantically distinguish when something includes a period and when it does not. Deal with it.
