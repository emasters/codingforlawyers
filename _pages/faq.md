## What? Lawyers and Coding?

It's true. Lawyers *can* code. In fact, if you're a lawyer, the truth is that it's easier than you think. I am a lawyer, and a coder.[^1] In the course of two years, I have gone from knowing essentially *nothing* to being a decent coder in several languages. This book is intended to drastically shorten that time for others who, like me, decide that they want to learn to code.

## Why this book?

One thing that I discovered, when learning to code, is that there are surprisingly few freely available books on the *basics* of coding, books that assume you know *nothing* about coding, books that assume you went to law school because you didn't like numbers.[^2] And, we need more lawyers who code.

## What can I do to help?

At the moment, I am still making many decisions about this project, and I want your feedback. Is it worth it? Are any lawyers actually interested? Are the chapters too dense? Too easy? Are there topics that you definitely want covered? A great way to help would be to send me an email at <dave@esq.io> and let me know what you think. An even better way is to [submit an issue on GitHub or submit a pull request](https://github.com/vzvenyach/codingforlawyers/issues).

## When will you finish?

This is obviously still a work-in-progress. I expect that it will take me a few months to get it into `1.0` shape. If there's a large demand, I'll prioritize it accordingly. So, please send feedback.

## How can I stay current on latest developments?

You can sign up for my mailing list: <https://tinyletter.com/codingforlawyers>. I promise not to use your information for any purpose other than to update you about this book. I will not knowingly share your email or any other personal information with any other person.

## No banner ads? No fee?

No. Inspired by [Matthew Butterick's Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com), it is my plan to offer this as a free ebook. But, if you feel compelled to contribute, I have set up a [Dwolla Hub](https://www.dwolla.com/hub/esqio). No amount over $50 will be accepted and, due to ethical restrictions associated with my day job, if you happen to do business with the District of Columbia government, do not make any contributions.

## Is this book legal advice?

Obviously not. Don't be ridiculous.
